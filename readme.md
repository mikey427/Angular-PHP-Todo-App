Hello Adam, this is my submission for the Todo App mini-project. I did it in the companies Tech Stack to better demonstrate my dedication to learning and my skills. This has not been easy, but just over the weekend, I have learned so much. I built the app in Angular with Typescript with a PHP backend with laravel. I attempted to use MySQL because that is what you use, however, I was having issues getting that database up and running. So I just used what I had. There are some key features that I left out in order to get this project to you in a timely manner such as authentication and error handling. After building this application, there are a couple things I would do differently next time, such as using local storage to store information instead of passing data around through the router and maybe set up my API in such a way that is a little bit more scaleable. For set up, just be sure to connect your database to the backend. Overall, this has been a very fun little project that required me to learn a ton in a short time span. I would like to thank you for this amazing opportunity.
